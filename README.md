# 4-Servo-Motors
This Arduino project on Tinkercad uses 4 servo motors connected to an Arduino board. Each motor is programmed to run the standard "Sweep" movement—oscillating back and forth between 0° and 180°—for 2 seconds. After the 2-second sweeping period, all four servos stop and hold their position at 90 degrees,
