# 4-Servo-Motors
This Arduino project on Tinkercad uses 4 servo motors connected to an Arduino board. Each motor is programmed to run the standard "Sweep" movement—oscillating back and forth between 0° and 180°—for 2 seconds. After the 2-second sweeping period, all four servos stop and hold their position at 90 degrees,

This is useful for applications where a startup animation or self-check is needed before setting into a ready state.

Components Used:
Arduino Uno

4x Servo motors

Breadboard (optional for power distribution)

Jumper wires

Wiring:
Servo 1: Signal to pin 2

Servo 2: Signal to pin 3

Servo 3: Signal to pin 4

Servo 4: Signal to pin 5

All servos: VCC to 5V, GND to GND
